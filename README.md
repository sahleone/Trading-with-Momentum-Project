### Project 1: Trading with Momentum

Implement a momentum trading strategy in Python and test to see if it could be profitable

#### Project Overview 
In this project, we will implement a mmomentum trading strategy, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. We will be supplied with a universe of stocks and time range from Quotemedia. We will also be provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. We will then compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.


#### Conclusion
T-test returned a p-value of 0.073359.
As the p-value is greater than the significance level alpha = 0.025, we do not reject the null hypothesis.
We cannot conclude from t-test that our signal was not strong enough to give profitable returns.
